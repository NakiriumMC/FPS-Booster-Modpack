## Introduction
Welcome! The FPS Booster Modpack is a collection of mods for Minecraft aimed at reducing lag and enhancing game performance by increasing the frames per second (FPS) you experience. Enjoy smoother gameplay and enhanced optimization with this modpack.

## Recommendation
If you have a Nvidia 16 series or higher video card, I recommend adding [Nvidium](https://modrinth.com/mod/nvidium) it is very good to increase your fps.
> Nvidium mod is not functional on **non-Nvidia systems**, but the Nvidium will automatically disable itself. Your gameplay will not be affected.

## How to Play the Modpacks?
- You can use [Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app) or read [documentation](https://support.modrinth.com/en/articles/8802250-modpacks-on-modrinth) about modpack installation in other launchers
